# GIS and Visualization Toolbox using Xpra

This image uses [Xpra](xpra.org) with [OpenBox](http://openbox.org/) to provide access to a think desktop environment to run GIS analysis and visualization tools. 

NetCDF visualization tools include [Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/) and [Ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html). 

GIS Tools include QGIS, NCO, and dependencies for development with netcdf.

This image is intended for use with the TERRA-REF Analysis Workbench for hyperspectral data products.
