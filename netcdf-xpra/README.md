# Xpra + OpenBox + NetCDF

This image uses [Xpra](xpra.org) with [OpenBox](http://openbox.org/) to provide access to a think desktop environment to run NetCDF visualization tools including [Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/) and [Ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html). Image also contains dependencies necessary for NCO development.  

This image is intended for use with the TERRA-REF Analysis Workbench for hyperspectral data products.
